    //
    // A3 (2026-07-13, see the menu-shown callback below) left the gameplay
    // layer alone on the grounds that "kPausesGame + the kInventory menu
    // context already keep clicks from the gameplay layer". That is true only
    // while we pause. Under "!nopause" the world is live, and every binding the
    // grid shares a button with fires underneath it -- attack, shout, activate,
    // jump -- while the player is only trying to move an item (user report).
    //
    // ★★NOT inputEventHandlingEnabled. That is exactly what A3 tried and
    // reverted: toggling a handler's own flag mid-hold corrupts its held-input
    // bookkeeping, and the symptom was a POWER ATTACK firing on close after an
    // in-menu right-click. ControlMap masks the USER EVENTS instead -- the same
    // door Papyrus's DisablePlayerControls goes through -- so a button held
    // across the boundary leaves no half-state behind to be completed later.
    //
    // ★★SAVE THE WORD THE ENGINE ACTUALLY HAD, and put that back. A blanket
    // re-enable on close is not a restore: a quest, a cutscene or another mod
    // may have disabled controls for its own reasons before we ever opened, and
    // handing them all back would be us ending someone else's scene.
    //
    // ★★★AND ONE WRITE AT OPEN IS NOT A MASK, IT IS A WISH.
    //
    // Reported: the block holds for the inventory and does nothing when the
    // grid comes up over a chest or a corpse. The log says the mask WAS laid
    // down on that open, at the same point in the same callback as every other
    // open ([INPUT] gameplay controls masked, 3ms after the ContainerMenu
    // close) -- so the mask is not missing, it is being overwritten.
    //
    // Which is exactly the shape the loot/barter door has and the inventory
    // door does not. The container is reached by ACTIVATING a reference: the
    // engine's own activation bookkeeping runs on the far side of the close
    // event we open from, and whatever it hands back to enabledControls lands
    // after our write. Same for the barter screen (dialogue) and the
    // pickpocket/steal modes, which are the same ContainerMenu.
    //
    // The same log carries the second half of it. The word we saved decayed
    // across the session -- 0xffffffff, then 0xffffffdf (kPOVSwitch), then
    // 0xffffff9f (kPOVSwitch + kFighting) -- because a lockpicking menu's own
    // disable was still outstanding when we saved, and SetControlsState wrote
    // that whole stale word back at close. We were freezing OTHER people's
    // transient disables permanently.
    //
    // So both halves stop being whole-word one-shots:
    //
    //   * the mask is RE-ASSERTED every unpaused frame it is meant to hold
    //     (ReassertGameplayInput, driven from the Update hook, the same
    //     treatment and the same reason as SetMoveInput above), which does not
    //     care who overwrites it or when; and
    //   * we remember the bits WE actually turned off and give back only
    //     those. A bit that was already off at open is somebody else's to
    //     restore, and one they turn off during our session stays off.

    bool          g_maskHealing  = false;   // a heal is in flight (log it once)

    // ★kMenu and kConsole are DELIBERATELY absent. kMenu is the channel our own
    // menu is fed on (Creator sets the kInventory context for exactly that
    // reason), so masking it would silence the grid along with the world; and
    // the console is a separate window the player must keep being able to
    // raise -- ProcessScaleformEvent already stands aside for it rather than
    // fighting it.
    // ★★★kFighting AND kSneaking ARE DELIBERATELY ABSENT TOO, and they cost
    // more to leave out than the two above.
    //
    // Reported, twice, in the same shape. First: opening the inventory -- or
    // the grid over a body -- always sheathes the player's weapons. Then, with
    // that fixed: it still stands them up out of sneak.
    //
    // Nothing in this plugin sheathes or unsneaks anything; the engine does,
    // and it does it because of these two bits. Taking them down is the same
    // door Papyrus's DisablePlayerControls(abFighting, abSneaking) goes
    // through, and putting the weapon away and standing the player up is part
    // of what that door DOES. Under kPausesGame nobody ever saw either one,
    // because the mask did not exist there; the mask arrived with "!nopause"
    // and brought both with it.
    //
    // ★★THE TELL, for the next bit that turns out to belong on this list: a
    // USER_EVENT_FLAG is not always input-only. Most of them (kMovement,
    // kLooking, kActivate, kJumping...) only decide whether a button reaches a
    // handler, and taking one down changes no world state at all. These two
    // ALSO carry a piece of the player's stance, and the engine settles that
    // stance the moment the bit drops. A flag that names a STATE the player can
    // be in, rather than an action they can take, cannot go through ControlMap.
    //
    // Neither can be undone after the fact. Re-drawing or re-crouching on close
    // is a flicker at best and a fight with the engine at worst, and neither
    // answers the real complaint: the world is LIVE now, so a player who opens
    // the grid mid-fight has been disarmed while they browse, and one who opens
    // it while sneaking past a draugr has been stood up in front of it.
    //
    // So both bits stay up and the BUTTONS behind them are silenced one layer
    // earlier instead -- blank-call-restore at PlayerControls' own entry point,
    // where the wheel already does exactly this for movement (Wheeler.cpp,
    // InputLock). enabledControls never loses either flag, so the engine is
    // never told to change anyone's stance, and a button held across the
    // boundary still reads as released to the handler that has to tidy it up.
    //
    // ★No enum operators on USER_EVENT_FLAG in this CommonLib line, so the mask
    // is built in the underlying type and cast back at the call.

    //   * storedControls -- the engine's OWN stash, written by StoreControls()
    //     and pushed back over enabledControls by LoadStoredControls(). This is
    //     the prime suspect: anything that stashes the word at the START of a
    //     conversation stashes it with OUR bits already down, and hands that
    //     stale word back when the conversation ends. This file has already
    //     been on the other side of exactly that bug -- see the lockpicking
    //     note in SetGameplayInput.
    //   * the input context stack -- a context left on it outlives the menu
    //     that pushed it, and the top of that stack decides whether a key is
    //     movement at all.
    //   * the movement/look handlers and blockPlayerInput -- the door that is
    //     not ControlMap: SetMoveInput's, and Papyrus's.
    //   * ...and WHICH MENUS ARE OPEN, added after the shop report. A player
    //     who cannot move because a menu nobody can see is still on the stack
    //     is not a control-state bug at all, and no amount of reading the four
    //     words above would ever have said so. The set is compared as a hash
    //     and spelled out only on the line that prints, so an open or a close
    //     anywhere in the game shows up in the same timeline as the bits.
    //
    // One compare per unpaused frame, and a line only when something actually
    // changed. Each line carries whether OUR menu and the dialogue were up, so
    // the timeline reads on its own.
    //
    // ★★★IT ANSWERED ITS QUESTION AND IS KEPT ANYWAY, behind "!movewatch" like
    // every other diagnostic in this project. What it caught, twice, in one
    // session: `stored` sat at 0x80000000 -- nothing stashed -- until the
    // moment a conversation began, and then became 0xfffff8d8, bit for bit the
    // live word WITH OUR MASK IN IT. That is a StoreControls() at dialogue
    // start photographing the world through the mask, and a LoadStoredControls()
    // at dialogue end printing it back. 0xfffff8d8 is the freeze's fingerprint:
    // movement, looking, activate, POV, main-four, wheel-zoom and jumping all
    // down at once, owned by nobody.
    //
    // It also ruled things OUT, which is half of why it is worth keeping:
    // move=1 look=1 block=0 the whole way through, and the context stack
    // returning cleanly to [0], is what says the handlers and the context stack
    // were never involved. The next report of this shape deserves the same
    // timeline rather than another round of theory -- and off by default, it
    // costs an atomic load on a frame nobody is measuring.
