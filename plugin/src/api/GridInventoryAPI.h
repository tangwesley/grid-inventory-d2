//  Grid Inventory -- extension ABI v1
// =============================================================================
//  This header is the ONLY thing shared between Grid Inventory (the host, which
//  owns the grid, the tiles and every pixel drawn) and an extension plugin (a
//  "provider", which owns gameplay data the host knows nothing about).
//
//  ABI DISCIPLINE -- the rules below are not style, they are the contract:
//
//   1. <cstdint> is the sole dependency. No CommonLibSSE-NG type, no Dear ImGui
//      type, no STL type ever crosses the boundary. A provider built against a
//      different CommonLib revision, a different ImGui version or a different
//      MSVC runtime must still link and run.
//   2. Every struct is POD with explicit padding and a static_assert on its
//      size. Adding a field to a released struct is a breaking change: bump
//      kABIVersion instead.
//   3. Strings are fixed char[] buffers, UTF-8, NUL-terminated. Never a pointer
//      the other side has to free.
//   4. Pointer arguments are borrowed for the duration of the call only.
//   5. The provider NEVER calls ImGui. It returns data; the host draws it with
//      its own draw list, its own atlas and its own theme. Sharing an ImGui
//      context across a DLL boundary would require sharing the context pointer
//      AND the allocator, and any version drift between the two plugins would
//      be an undiagnosable CTD.
//
//  THREADING -- GetOverlay / GetTooltipLines / OfferDrop / GetTier / GetLines are
//  all called from the host's render thread inside an active ImGui frame. Do not
//  block, allocate, or call a game API that can open or close a menu.
//
//  HANDSHAKE (SKSE messaging, both plugins register a listener in
//  SKSEPluginLoad so ordering does not matter):
//
//      kPostLoad :  host     --[ kMsgHostReady, const HostReady* ]--> everyone
//      kPostLoad :  provider --[ kMsgRegisterProvider, const Provider* ]--> "GridInventory"
//
//  ★AND ONE SIGNAL THAT RUNS THE OTHER WAY (1.4.1):
//
//      any time  :  host     --[ kMsgCostumeState, const CostumeState* ]--> everyone
//
//  Everything above is the outside EXTENDING our UI: we call a Provider and it
//  answers. The costume signal is the opposite direction -- we announce, nobody
//  answers -- so it needs no Provider and no registration. A plugin that does
//  not know this message simply never sees it, which is why adding it did NOT
//  require an ABI bump: message types are separate namespaces, and existing
//  extensions are untouched.
//
//  ★REGISTER TWO LISTENERS, SPLIT BY SENDER (learned the hard way, 2026-07-30):
//
//      RegisterListener(OnLifecycle);            // == RegisterListener("SKSE", ..)
//      RegisterListener(nullptr, OnApiMessage);  // no filter
//
//   Why both:
//    - The one-argument shorthand is RegisterListener("SKSE", cb), which filters
//      out everything a *plugin* sends. With only that, the handshake fails
//      silently in BOTH directions: the host's broadcast never arrives, and the
//      provider's Dispatch finds no matching listener and returns false.
//    - A single unfiltered listener cannot replace the pair, because message
//      type numbers live in the SENDER's namespace. Another plugin's "type 1"
//      is indistinguishable from kPostLoad and its "type 4" from kPostLoadGame,
//      so lifecycle handling would fire at random. Do NOT try to sort it out by
//      inspecting msg->sender -- what that string holds for SKSE's own messages
//      is not something to guess at, and guessing wrong silently disables every
//      lifecycle branch you own.
//    - The unfiltered listener must therefore touch ONLY the 4CC types below.
//      Registering both works because the two use different sender keys.
//
//  The host refuses any Provider whose abiVersion != kABIVersion or whose
//  structSize != sizeof(Provider). Refusal is a log line plus an in-game
//  notification -- never a CTD, never a silent no-op.
//
//  Vendor this file verbatim into a consumer project. Do not edit the copy.

    // Sending UI_MESSAGE_TYPE::kHide to "GridInventoryMenu" does the same
    // thing and needs no header -- that is the standard courtesy and it is
    // answered. This message exists for the case where the intent should be
    // unambiguous: the engine also sends kHide, so a host that wants to know
    // the request came from a MOD rather than from the game reads this one.
    //
    // The grid stays OPEN throughout: its board, the item on the cursor and
    // every sub-window survive, and IsMenuOpen() keeps answering true --
    // it reports the SESSION, not whether the board is on screen, so it does
    // not move when you suppress. (1.5.1 answered liveness there by mistake,
    // which told a client its own suppression was the player closing the
    // inventory; fixed in 1.5.2.)
    //
    // ★★YOU OWN THE HOLD. This message is not the same as kHide in one way
    // that matters: the host's safety net recovers a kHide by watching the
    // MENU STACK, and your window may not be on it at all -- an overlay
    // drawn outside the menu system is invisible to any such test, and the
    // net used to revoke those suppressions about a fifth of a second in.
    // A hold taken with this message is not second-guessed that way, and the

    //
    // Not just the normal one. The cancel, the error return, the hotkey that
    // closes it, the load that happens while it is up -- every exit. While
    // you hold this the player cannot see the inventory and cannot reach it,
    // so a path that forgets is a soft lock, and no timer is coming: a build
    // of this host did carry a ten-minute backstop and it was removed,
    // because nobody sits in front of a frozen game for ten minutes. They
    // kill the process at two.
    //
    // The only other things that take the hold back are the ones that end the
    // session your window was living over anyway: our own close, a save load,
    // and a new game.
    //
    // ★SEND IT WHILE THE INVENTORY IS OPEN. There is nothing to step aside
    // from otherwise, and a hold banked against a session that has not started
    // would surface at the next open as a board that never draws. So one taken
    // with the inventory closed is refused, with a line in our log saying so.
    // Check IsMenuOpen() first, or just send it when your window opens over us.

    // population an extension has something to say about. Every affixed iron
    // sword in a chest arrives at that hook under the same key as every plain
    // one, so a line built from it would be right by luck or not at all. The

    // ★★WHY NOT SIMPLY GROW Tinter. Rule 2 at the top of this file: adding a
    // field to a released struct is a breaking change, and the host refuses any
    // table whose structSize disagrees. Growing Tinter would stop every already
    // built extension from colouring anything, and bumping kABIVersion to cover
    // that would ALSO refuse every existing Provider -- a socket mod losing its
    // badges because a loot mod wanted a tooltip line. Additive costs nobody
    // anything: kABIVersion does not move, no released struct changes size, and
    // a plugin that has never heard of this message simply never sends one.
    //
    // Provider, Tinter and Annotator are three independent slots. Register any
    // combination; holding one has never implied holding another.
