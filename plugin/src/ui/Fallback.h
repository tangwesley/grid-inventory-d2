    //   - icon theme "flat": every item draws its category icon
    //   - icon theme "real": only items whose 3D capture permanently failed
    //
    // The folder itself is the customisation surface -- there is no tool and no
    // manifest. Drop in a PNG named after the key and it wins. The shipped set
    // is PNG for exactly that reason, so "what do I name it?" is answered by
    // looking at what is already there. Resolution order:
    //
    //   item\<Plugin.esp_0xLocalID>.png   one form only
    //   <key>@<variant>.png               e.g. wpn_sword@steel
    //   <key>.png                         e.g. wpn_sword
    //   <key>@<variant>.fic  /  <key>.fic  1.0.4 leftovers, still read
    //
    // The entire PNG layer outranks the entire .fic layer. Ranking them
    // key-by-key instead would mean that a player who drops in wpn_sword.png to
    // change "all swords" finds steel swords unchanged, because our shipped
    // wpn_sword@steel.fic is the more specific match. That rule is correct and
    // useless.
