    // ★GI74: ENGLISH IS THE ONLY COMPILED LANGUAGE. Korean, Chinese, Japanese
    // and everything after them live as text in GridInventory_lang\, on the
    // exact same footing as a user's own translation — so a typo in the Korean
    // is a text edit, not a rebuild, and deleting the folder leaves a working
    // English UI rather than a broken one.
    //
    // English stays compiled because it is the FALLBACK: any key a pack has
    // not translated resolves here, so there has to be a copy no file can
    // delete. en.ini may still overlay it like any other language.
    //
    // X-macro: ONE row per string — the enum and the English table are both
    // generated from THIS list, so the former positional desync (a missing
    // entry nullptr-crashed at runtime with no compile error) is physically
    // impossible. Adding a string = adding one row here; translations catch up
    // through their .ini files and show English until they do.
    //   X(name, en)
    // ★★EQUIP SLOT strings. The nine slots the doll knows, plus "Accessory"
    // for every biped slot it does not -- which is what SlotAccepts already
    // files them as, so the tooltip and the doll cannot disagree.
    // ★Bethesda names the mod slots too (kModBack and friends) and they are
    // deliberately NOT used: modders ignore that intent (47 carries backpacks,
    // capes, quivers and wings alike), while the NUMBER is never wrong and is
    // what every mod page and conflict guide quotes.
    // ★Nothing multi-line may sit INSIDE the macro below -- each line needs a
    // trailing backslash and one missing ends it. That is why this is here.
