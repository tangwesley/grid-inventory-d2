//  GI8 -- extension badge overlay
// =============================================================================
//  A provider (see api/GridInventoryAPI.h) can put up to 8 "badges" on one item
//  instance -- the socket mod's wells, for example. The GEOMETRY is ours: the
//  provider returns a count and per-badge contents, and this module decides
//  where they sit inside the tile and what a well looks like.
//
//  Placement is a lookup TABLE rather than a formula (PLAN_INSTANCE 3-A).
//  Three attempts at deriving it from `cols = min(w, n)` all disagreed with the
//  original layout, because the interesting positions land on HALF-cell
//  boundaries: five badges on a 2-wide tile form a dice five, and its centre
//  pip sits between the two columns. Cell-snapped arithmetic cannot express
//  that, so the row shape for each (tile, n) is written out and looked up.
// =============================================================================
