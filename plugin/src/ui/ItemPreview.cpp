        // the two differ by 1.8x. Precache in a cave and the whole set comes
        // out dark; the shipped pak was made outdoors, so an icon captured
        // indoors later does not match the ones beside it.

        // Overriding BSShaderManager::State::directionalAmbientTransform DOES
        // fix the icons -- measured, 1.00x against the shipped pak from a dark
        // interior. It was removed anyway, because three things are all true
        // at once and together they leave no way to do it invisibly:
        //   1. the ambient is ONE GLOBAL. ShadowSceneNode -- the per-scene
        //      object -- carries lights, fog and a portal graph, but no
        //      ambient, so a separate scene cannot have a separate sky.
        //   2. the WORLD RENDERS BEFORE THE CAPTURE (Tick -> world -> 
        //      PostDisplay), so anything written early enough for the capture
        //      lights the world the player is looking at.
        //   3. writing it LATE, on the line before inv->Render(), reaches
        //      nothing: the frame's shader constants are already uploaded.
