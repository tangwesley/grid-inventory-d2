    // both built out of cell-sized blocks (the board is BaseCols() x BaseRows()
    // of them; every slot is 2x2, weapons 2x4), and together they are most of
    // the window's width — how much depends on how wide the board is set.
    // So "make the window smaller" has exactly one lever and this is it —
    // which is why it inherited the name. ★GRID SIZE is the other half of the
    // same question and deliberately not this control: that one changes how
    // MANY cells there are, this one changes how big they are drawn.
    //
    // ★★TWO NUMBERS, deliberately. The board's shipped size was 0.90 of the
    // cell constants, and a slider that reads 0.90 at the default invites the
    // question "0.90 of WHAT" — the answer being an internal constant nobody
    // outside this file can see. So the SETTING is 1.00 at the shipped size
    // and the 0.90 moved here, where it is the definition of 1.00 rather than
    // a number the player has to interpret.
    //   ScaleSetting()  what the slider shows and the ini stores — 1.00 default

    // player to say "this text is too small for me". On a high-resolution
    // screen that is a real complaint even after the automatic 1.5x, because
    // how big 17px reads depends on the panel and how far away it is, not on
    // its pixel count. Reported by more than one 4K user.
    //
    // It multiplies Scale() rather than replacing it, so the automatic sizing
    // still does its job and this rides on top: 1.00 keeps exactly what
    // shipped. It reaches every string in two places -- style.FontScaleMain
    // for the ones ImGui sizes (tooltips, running text, stack counts) and
    // SnapPx for the ones we size ourselves (values, captions) -- and needs no
    // atlas rebuild at all: ImGui 1.92 rasterises each size on demand.
    //
    // ★Layout is NOT scaled by this. Rows grow because the text in them is
    // taller, and windows measure their own content now, so they follow. The
    // board's cell size has its own slider and stays where the player put it.
    //
    // ★★The value is NOT applied while the slider is held -- see RowFontScale.
    // The settings panel is built out of the text this setting sizes, so
    // applying it live re-laid that panel out and slid the slider out from
    // under the cursor holding it. Deferring to the release is not a nicety
    // here; it is the difference between a control and a moving target.
    // ★kFontScaleStep is the ARROW step only -- the track stays continuous, so
