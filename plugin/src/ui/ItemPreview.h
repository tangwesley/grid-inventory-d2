        // ★★★THE ALPHA IS THE POINT; the magenta is only a fallback tint.
        //
        // This used to be alpha 1.0, and IconCache found transparency by
        // looking for magenta. That works until an item has an alpha texture:
        // a half-transparent pixel comes back blended with the backdrop, so it
        // is neither the model's colour nor pure magenta, and it was kept as
        // an opaque purple sheet (reported -- a bridal veil).
        //
        // Clearing alpha to 0 instead let us ask whether the engine writes
        // real alpha. It does:
        //
        //   after-clear   alpha 0=100.0%  mid=0.0%  255=0.0%
        //   after-model   alpha 0=94.1%   mid=5.3%  255=0.5%
        //
        // So IconCache reads transparency rather than guessing at it. The RGB
        // stays magenta because a blended pixel still carries the backdrop's
        // cast, and min(R,B)-G is exactly how much of it to remove -- being
        // symmetric in R/B, that arithmetic never has to care whether the
        // surface is BGRA or RGBA.
        // ★★★GI77: TWO BACKDROPS, AND ALPHA IS NEVER READ AGAIN.
        //
        // One backdrop cannot tell a half-transparent pixel from an opaque
        // pixel of the backdrop's colour, and every heuristic that followed --
        // the magenta spill, the hides rule, the colour-key fallback, the
        // one-pixel reach -- was an attempt to guess which it was. Two
        // backdrops make it arithmetic. The same model is drawn once over
        // black and once over white; where the two agree the pixel is opaque,
        // where they differ by the whole backdrop it is transparent, and the
        // difference in between IS the transparency. The colour comes straight
        // out of the black pass. No surface alpha is consulted, so a 10-bit
        // surface with two alpha bits and a surface that hands back none at
        // all get exactly the same result as a perfect one.
        //
        // A SPELL takes the black pass only: an additive glow over white
