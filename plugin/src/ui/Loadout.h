// Loadout tabs (UI label "프리셋"): each tab is an independent equipment set.
// The ACTIVE tab's set is what the character actually wears. Switching snapshots
// the leaving tab's worn gear, unequips all, then re-equips the target set. Gear
// held by an inactive tab is hidden from the grid (see IsReserved). Real equip —
// stats follow the set, no fragile hooks.
//
// Internal name "Loadout" avoids clashing with the pre-existing editor "preset"
// (icon/category config sharing).
//
// ★A SET IS EVERY SLOT ON THE DOLL, including the ones the engine does not
// wear itself. The second ring is worn by DualRing's carrier with the ring in
// the pack, so the worn scan cannot see it and an ordinary unequip cannot take
// it off -- it has to be snapshotted, stood down and re-worn through DualRing,
// or the doll's bottom-right slot keeps its ring through every switch while
// every other slot changes.

    // ★THE FIRST PRESET IS FREE and always exists: a new character has EQUIP
    // and one empty preset, and deleting that preset empties it rather than
    // removing it. It is not counted by NextCost, so the first tab the player
    // actually buys still costs 5000. It IS counted by AtCap, since the wheel
    // has to show it like any other tab.
    //
    // ★★NINE, because the quick wheel has ten places and EQUIP takes one of
    // them. The cap used to be 20, which the inventory strip could show and the
    // wheel could not: tab eleven onward simply never appeared there, with
    // nothing said about it. A limit the player cannot see is worse than a
    // lower one they can, and "buy a tab that half the mod ignores" is not a
    // purchase anyone would make knowingly.
    // ★This counts PRESETS, not tabs -- EQUIP is not a preset and is not sold.
    // Wheeler.cpp static_asserts that the two still agree, so raising this
    // without widening the wheel fails the build rather than the player.
    // ★Saves made under the old cap keep every tab they have: nothing is
    // deleted, only further purchases stop. Those extra tabs still work in the
    // inventory; they are the ones the wheel could never show anyway.

    // preference about where a thing appears.

    // back a snapshot taken when the tab was last switched to -- correct for
    // every tab except the one being worn, which is the one that changes. The
    // rule was "do not ask about the active tab", the costume system obeyed it
    // by excluding that tab, and the quick menu did not: it drew the weapon a
    // preset held at the last switch, so equipping a sword changed nothing
    // until the player switched away and back. A getter with a caveat is a
    // getter that will be called wrongly, so the caveat is gone instead: the
    // active tab is brought back in step with the worn gear every tick.
