// 1.4 / B4-2 -- the WORN LEDGER.
//
// The board holds only unworn units, and re-reads who is worn from the
// engine's ExtraWorn on every derivation -- which is why half the exclusion
// ladder exists (PLAN_B4_DEMOLITION §2). Before that arithmetic can flip to
// "the board knows", the ledger has to prove it can stay in step with the
// engine on requests and events alone.
//
// B4-2b: this tracks ENTRIES, not counts. The first observation round ran at
// count level and scored 30/30 -- but the takeOne ladder's questions about worn
// state ("has my equip landed?", "is this doll carry still on the body?") turn
// on windows where the engine's flag count and the ledger's count are equal
// while meaning different things. Only identity plus a lifecycle can answer
// those. So the ledger now carries what the REQUEST knew (uid, sig and hand --
// rule 2: the request is the only moment that knows which unit) through the
// states that the takeOne clock machinery currently juggles by matching worn
// lists:
//
//     pending  -- our equip request is out; the engine has not applied it
//     worn     -- the engine confirmed (TESEquipEvent), or wore it unasked
//                 (slot-conflict removal's counterpart, loadout, script)
//
// An unequip event retires one worn entry. A `doffing` state -- our unequip
// request in flight -- joined in B4-2c for the doll-carry question, and
// ★that question CONSUMES the ledger now: Doffing() is the carry clock (see
// Grid.cpp's off-board walk). The sentence here used to end "nothing consumes
// the ledger until then" and stayed after B4-2c landed. The audit is still
// observation-only -- the engine remains the authority for the counts -- but
// "nothing" has not been true for a while.
//
// One entry = one WORN LIST -- the unit both sides agree on.
//
// ★★EXCEPT AMMO, and this note used to claim ammo was the EXAMPLE ("a quiver
// equips as one list however many arrows ride in it, and the event fires
// once"). It is the counterexample. The engine POOLS arrows on its own terms:
// measured 2026-09-02 in one session, the same quiver appeared as one worn
// list of 200 and as three of 99/49/52, and an unequip logged
// `Steel Arrow x199 (3 worn list(s))`. Counting entries against a number that
// moves by itself produced "ledger 9 vs engine 0" for four sessions running.
//
// ★So an ammo form keeps ONE entry with its units summed, and the audit asks
// whether the quiver is ON THE BACK rather than how many lists said so. The
// count stays the engine's -- the doll already reads it there.
//
// Rebaselined wholesale at every load (rule 3). Every menu open and close
// audits entry counts against a fresh ExtraWorn walk AND reports lifecycle
// residue (a pending that never landed), bending to the engine on mismatch
// -- the engine stays the authority until B4-2c flips consumption.
