// THE SECOND RING.
//
// The engine wears exactly one. BipedAnim is `BIPOBJECT objects[kTotal]` --
// one item per slot -- and kRing is a single bit, so a second ring has
// nowhere to go. Moving the slot does not help: probed three ways (both
// masks moved, ARMO only, and claiming NO slot at all) the engine took the
// first ring off every time, so whatever it single-ends on, it is not the
// biped slot. ETYP is not it either -- both rings report 0.
//
// So the second ring is not worn AS a ring. A CARRIER of ours is equipped in
// its place -- costume anchor 32 (0x84A), which is not a ring and so nothing
// single-ends it -- borrowing the ring's ENCHANTMENT. The ring itself stays in
// the pack, and the UI shows it on the doll's second ring slot.
//
// ★★★NO MODEL, and that is a settled question rather than an omission. A
// skinned mesh carries its own slot number inside the NIF
// (BSDismemberSkinInstance::partitions[i].slot), and for every ring it is 36 --
// which the FIRST ring already occupies. Nothing set on the ARMO or the ARMA
// changes it, so within the equipment system the second ring cannot be drawn:
// make the addon claim kRing and it loses the contest for 36; take kRing off it
// and nothing matches 36 at all. (Measured: the second ring appeared the
// instant the first was removed, i.e. when 36 came free.)
// Outside the equipment system it is no better -- a model loaded by hand
// through BSModelDB comes back with `skin=NO`, because binding a skin to the
// skeleton is work the engine does while building a part.
// Both routes were taken to the end. The effect applies; the ring is invisible.
