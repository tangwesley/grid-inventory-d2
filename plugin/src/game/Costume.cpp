        // real helmet out of the player's pack, which worked but applied that
        // helmet's stats -- exactly what this feature promises not to do.
        //
        // ★★EIGHT carriers, one addon. A costume can leave several slots bare at
        // once (helmet AND amulet AND ring AND cape), and one carrier cannot
        // serve them: armorAddons is overwritten per-ARMO, so two pieces sharing
        // a carrier would have to share an appearance. The ARMA is shared freely
        // -- it is never rendered, only replaced.
        // ★24, not 8. Eight was a guess at how many slots a costume leaves
        // bare, and a real set overran it: a 17-piece outfit needed 11 and the
        // last three simply did not appear -- silently, apart from one warning
        // in the log.
        // ★★★32, not 24 -- and "24 is every slot a costume can cover" was
        // simply wrong when it was written. BipedObjectSlot spans 32 bits and
        // CoversSlot excludes only the shield, so 31 pieces can each want a
        // slot of their own; 24 truncated seven of them.
        // What makes that reachable rather than theoretical is the cost model:
        // an anchor is spent per distinct donor ARMA, NOT per slot. A suit of
        // armour covering body+forearms+hands costs ONE. Jewellery is the
        // opposite -- one ARMA, one slot -- so a multi-ring mod, which gives
        // every ring a custom slot of its own, spends one anchor per ring.
        // Eight rings on top of the 11 that 17-piece outfit needed is 19, and a
        // cloak, a backpack and a lantern take it past 24.
        // At 32 the array can no longer be the shortage: Apply() can build at
        // most 31 groups, so the warning below is now unreachable by counting
        // (it stays as the guard against that ever ceasing to be true).
        // ★★...which is exactly why the COSTUME stops at 31: the 32nd record
        // (0x84A) was the second ring's carrier. The costume could not want it
        // -- `need` is `j < groups.size()` and groups tops out at 31 -- but its
        // loop would still DROP one it found held, so the count was lowered
        // rather than shared. The reservation is free: nothing is taken from
        // the costume.
        // ★★★AND IT STAYS RESERVED AFTER 1.6.0, though nothing uses it. The
        // carrier's ESP record is kept (deleting it would break the references
        // in existing saves), and an old save can still be WEARING one until
        // SweepRetiredCarrier runs. Promoting 0x84A to an ordinary anchor
        // would put this system in a fight with that leftover over the same
        // form -- for a 32nd group Apply can never build anyway.
