// COSTUME — appearance-only outfits (PLAN_COSTUME.md).
//
// Stats keep coming from what is really equipped; the body shows the set held
// by whichever loadout tab is CHECKED. Nothing is equipped or unequipped for
// this: the equipped armour keeps its rating, keywords, perks, enchantment and
// tempering because it never stops being the equipped armour. Only its
// appearance list is borrowed for the length of one rebuild.
//
//   1. back up each worn armour's TESObjectARMO::armorAddons
//   2. overwrite them with the costume piece's addon for that slot
//      (or the SKIN's addon when the costume leaves the slot empty)
//   3. Actor::DoReset3D  -- synchronous; the engine builds the 3D from the
//      list it can see right now
//   4. put every list back
//
// Step 4 is neither optional nor deferrable. armorAddons lives on the shared
// form, so every actor wearing that armour reads the same array -- the window
// during which it holds the wrong value has to close inside the same call. It
// does, because DoReset3D is synchronous (measured).
//
// A costume piece's model reaches the body by borrowing the equipped item's
// addon list, so a slot with nothing equipped has no list to borrow. Empty slots
// are filled by ANCHORS (below) rather than left bare.

    // new one clears the old.

    [[nodiscard]] bool IsTab(int a_index);

    // a control that does nothing.

    // The loadout system calls this when a tab is deleted, so a costume that
    // pointed at it clears instead of dangling.
    void OnTabRemoved(int a_index);

    // ---- what the costume covers ---------------------------------------
    // Weapons, SHIELD and QUIVER are excluded by design. The equipment doll
    // greys those slots and shows the really-equipped item there, so ask here
    // rather than repeating the slot list at the call site.

    // ---- the anchors -----------------------------------------------------
    // A costume piece reaches the body by borrowing a WORN item's addon list,
    // so a slot the player left empty has no list and stays bare. An anchor
    // fills that gap: a placeholder ARMO (Grid Inventory.esp 0x82B..0x84A) with
    // 0 rating, 0 weight, 0 value, NO keywords and NO model, equipped into the
    // empty slot purely so there is a list to borrow.
    //
    // There are many anchors but they share one addon. Several slots can be
    // bare at once (helmet AND amulet AND ring AND cape) and a single anchor
    // cannot serve them all, because armorAddons is overwritten per-ARMO -- two
    // pieces sharing an anchor would have to share an appearance. The ARMA
    // itself is shared freely, since it is never rendered, only replaced.
    // Anchors are assigned per costume PIECE rather than per slot, so a
    // hair-plus-circlet helmet takes one anchor and not two.
    //
    // Carrying no keywords is the whole safety argument. Every vanilla
    // condition that asks "is this actor wearing armour" goes through
    // WornHasKeyword against ArmorHeavy, ArmorLight or ArmorClothing (verified
    // by scanning every CTDA in Skyrim.esm), so an anchor with none of them is
    // invisible to unarmoured builds, Mage Armor perks and the like.
    //
    // An anchor is not the player's property, so hide it everywhere the
    // player's own items appear: the grid, the doll, the capacity count,
    // tooltips and transfers.
    [[nodiscard]] bool IsAnchor(const RE::TESForm* a_form);

    // ---- applying -------------------------------------------------------
    // Rebuild the player's appearance from the current state. Cheap to call
    // when nothing changed (it compares against what it last applied); the
    // rebuild itself is not, which is why callers mark instead of applying.
    void Apply();

    // Something that can change the answer happened -- gear equipped or
    // removed, a tab switched, the costume tab re-checked, a cell loaded, a
    // transformation ended. Coalesced into one Apply on the next tick.
    void MarkDirty();
    void Tick();   // game thread; performs a pending Apply

    // A save has just finished loading. The costume is re-applied several times
    // over the next few seconds rather than once, because the engine keeps
    // rebuilding the actor after a load. Each of those rebuilds reads the addon
    // lists we have already put back, so the result is the plain body -- with
    // the anchors still worn, which shows up as a bald head. There is no event
    // for "the engine has finished", and the obvious probe does not work either
    // (the biped pointer is reused, so a rebuild cannot be detected from
    // outside), so we cover the window rather than watching for the end of it.
    void NoteGameLoaded();

    // ---- persistence ----------------------------------------------------
    // Which tab is checked is per-save state. Its own record rather than a
    // field on the loadout one: the two systems version independently, and a
    // costume that failed to load must not take the tabs down with it.
