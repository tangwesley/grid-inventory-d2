// 1.4 / B1 -- a kind-level audit, one step above B0. It started as
// observation-only and has since been promoted to permanent wiring; see the
// note on Take below.
//
// B0 counted FORMS. That is enough to ask "did the engine tell us everything",
// and the answer was yes. It is not enough to run a board: two iron daggers are
// the same form and different things the moment one of them is tempered.
//
// B1 counts KINDS -- form + InstanceSig -- and reports what moved between them.
// The question it exists to answer is PLAN §3 / REVIEW B-2:
//
//   **When N units of one form all change value at once, can the vanished
//   kinds be paired with the appeared ones without guessing?**
//
// If they cannot, 1.4 has not removed the matching problem, only moved it into
// the census, and §9 has a stopping rule about that.
//
// It records the RAW VALUES as well as the signature. The pairing rule in
// section 3 is "closest value first", and a signature is a hash, which has no
// notion of distance -- so that rule cannot be evaluated, let alone
// implemented, from signatures alone. Discovering this was itself part of what
// B1 was for.
//
// PROMOTED: this is on by default now, and no longer observation-only. Each
// Take ASSIGNS the pairs it used to merely rank -- greedily, fewest changed
// axes first, with normalised distance as the tiebreak (the rule B1 measured,
// PLAN section 8-4) -- and the rebuild's relabel block consumes that assignment
// through TakePair.
//
// Before this, N vacated pools met M arriving pools in HASH ORDER, which is no
// order at all. Two blades of the same form re-tempered in a single grindstone
// session (their values move, their counts do not, and no event fires) could
// come back seated in each other's cells at the next menu open -- the exact
// section 1(b) violation the census was built to measure.
//
// The assignment concerns UNWORN units only: a worn item is off the board, so
// charge drained in combat has nothing to relabel. "!census = 0" remains as an
// emergency cutoff, following the ledger's promotion pattern.
